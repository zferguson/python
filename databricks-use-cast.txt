Business Case for Implementing Databricks in the Analytics Team

Executive Summary:
The Analytics team currently faces significant inefficiencies and bottlenecks due to fragmented data sources and insufficient compute power. This hampers our ability to conduct high-quality, timely analytics and hinders business decision-making. We propose the adoption of Databricks, a unified analytics platform, to consolidate data access, enhance computational scalability, and accelerate data science and analytics workflows.

Current Challenges:
	1.	Fragmented Data Sources:
	•	Data is spread across Oracle, Snowflake, APIs, and flat files.
	•	Analysts must manually extract, transform, and join data, leading to delays and inconsistencies.
	•	Lack of a single pane of glass for querying and analyzing enterprise data.
	2.	Insufficient Compute Resources:
	•	Complex queries against large datasets (e.g., from Snowflake or Oracle) often timeout or perform poorly.
	•	Inability to prototype or run machine learning models at scale.
	•	Limited capacity for concurrent users during peak demand periods.
	3.	Workflow Inefficiencies:
	•	Siloed analytics efforts across tools like Python, SQL, and R.
	•	No shared compute environment for collaboration.
	•	Manual orchestration of ETL and analytic pipelines across systems.

Proposed Solution: Databricks
Databricks offers a cloud-native platform that solves our core problems by unifying data engineering, data science, and business analytics.

Key Benefits:
	1.	Unified Access Layer with Lakehouse Architecture:
	•	Integrates directly with Oracle, Snowflake, APIs, and flat files.
	•	Allows analytics teams to build a governed, scalable data lakehouse that supports both structured and unstructured data.
	2.	Elastic, High-Performance Compute:
	•	On-demand auto-scaling compute clusters optimized for analytics and machine learning workloads.
	•	Parallelized execution using Apache Spark significantly reduces query time.
	•	Enables efficient exploration of large datasets without performance degradation.
	3.	End-to-End Collaboration and Reproducibility:
	•	Shared notebooks support Python, SQL, R, and Scala in a single environment.
	•	Git integration and version control improve collaboration and auditability.
	•	Native support for ML lifecycle management (experimentation, tracking, and deployment).
	4.	Operational Efficiency and Automation:
	•	Scheduled workflows and jobs replace manual ETL steps.
	•	Integration with existing CI/CD and data governance frameworks.
	•	Role-based access controls and audit logging to support compliance.

Return on Investment (ROI):
	•	Time Savings: Reduce time spent on data wrangling and troubleshooting by 40-60%.
	•	Productivity Gains: Empower data analysts and data scientists to focus on higher-value tasks.
	•	Performance Improvements: Run queries and models 5-10x faster.
	•	Risk Mitigation: Reduce operational risk by standardizing and automating analytics processes.

Implementation Considerations:
	•	Phase 1: Establish connectivity with existing data sources (Oracle, Snowflake, APIs, flat files).
	•	Phase 2: Migrate core analytic workflows and build initial Lakehouse.
	•	Phase 3: Expand usage to data science and AI use cases, automate pipelines, and train staff.

Conclusion:
Adopting Databricks will significantly improve the Analytics team’s ability to deliver timely, scalable, and impactful insights. It addresses our critical pain points and positions us to support more advanced and real-time analytics use cases moving forward.

Recommendation:
Proceed with a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation of Databricks with a representative set of use cases to validate performance, integration, and usability benefits.
